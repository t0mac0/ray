A stereoscopic raytracer in C99. The only mode supported so far is
cross-eyed 3D. To compile:

    make

To run:

    ./ray

To see it in 3D, just cross your eyes, so that your left eye is looking
at the right image, and your right eye is looking at the left image.

3D](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBa-bCxsZDk).
